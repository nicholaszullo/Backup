Recitation day and time:  F 11-11:50

Assignment #:  4

Program due date:   11/12/19  

Handed in date:     11/12/19

Source code file name(s):   NetworkAnalysis.java Vertex.java Node.java Edge.java IndexMinPQ.java

Other file name(s) (if relevant): network_data1.txt network_data2.txt

Does your program run without error?: Yes

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

Additional comments to the grader: 
When running network_data2 and finding the min tree, keeping the seen[] array commented out yields a min path to 2 as from 5 with latency 8.69 E-8.
However, with the seen array used, the path is from 0 with latency 1.74E-7. I believe it is correct with the seen[] array commented out, but the expected output is not posted so I'm not sure.
