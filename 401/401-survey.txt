UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH SUMMER 2018 CS/COE 401 

--------------------------------------------------------
I have done some non trivial programming in the following programming languages:

[  ] NONE

[ x ] JAVA  

[  ] C

[  ] C++

[  ] FORTRAN

[  ] PASCAL

[  ] PHP

[ x ] PYTHON

[  ] PERL

[  ] RUBY

[  ] BASH or SH or CSH or KORN etc

[  ] MATLAB

[  ] VISUAL BASIC



List any computer science courses you have taken in High School/College/Tech School etc.


1) Computer Science (Intro to Java)


2) AP Computer Science


3) Independant study of python with AP Comp Sci teacher 



I understand these concepts from arithmetic:

[ x ] arithmetic operators  + - / *

[ x ] precedence of operations

[ ] boolean logic  AND NOT OR XOR




I understand these concepts from set theory:

[ ] union, intersection

[ ] set difference

[ ] XOR

[ ] cardinality, membership


I understand the following programming concepts fairly well:

[ x] a variable

[ x] data types such as integer flaoting point string boolean

[ x] an if else statement

[ x] iteration & loops  such as while loop, for loop, do loop

[x ] method/functions/subroutines

[x ] passing parameters and return values

[ x] arrays

[ x] reading writing files

[ x] recursion

[ ] backtracking

[ ] dynamic programming


It has been this long since I have written a non trivial program

[ ] Never wrote any programs

[x ] more than a couple months

[ ] over a year

[ ] a few years



I have heard that this course is:

[ ] very easy 

[ ] moderately easy

[ ] hard

[ ] extremely hard

[x ] heard nothing about it / no idea
