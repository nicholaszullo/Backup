#21    	Generating all permutations of a word creates word.length() factorial possible permutations, 
		which becomes impossible to use in an efficent algorithm once the word reaches a certain length       
#22     Upsizing by x2 is more efficient when you don't know the length of the file. It will be harder on the computer to upsize for every input if the input file is large, 
		compared to upsizing x2 and adjusting size at the end
