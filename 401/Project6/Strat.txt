Make step to neighbor function a recursive call, so it repeats itself and if dead end is ofound it bounces back to next call at previous point
Make cell -1 when checked
Unmark before recursion so bounce back to a 1 not a -1

		unmark curr r,c back to 1
	//Write for each direction but have different numbers for r,c depending on direction
	if (NE == 1)
		mark curr r,c as -1
		dfs(r,c,path) //but the numbers according to NE
		unmark curr r,c back to 1
	//Continue until all directions
