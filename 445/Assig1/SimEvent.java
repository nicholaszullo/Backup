// This class sets up the structure and functionality of events.

// The primary attribute of an event is its time stamp.  This will
// be used to compare / order events in a system.

// By using inheritance here, we enable the different types
// of events to be compatible but still distinguishable in an
// object-oriented way.  Note that I am using the parameterized
// Comparable interface of JDK 1.5.  Since the time values are double,
// we do not directly compare for equality -- rather we test to see if
// the difference between the two is very small.
public abstract class SimEvent implements Comparable<SimEvent>
{
	protected double e_time;  // Time when event was generated

	public SimEvent(double new_time)
	{
		e_time = new_time;
	}
	
	public double get_e_time()
	{
		return e_time;
	}

	// This method will allow events to be ordered (ex: via a
	// PriorityQueue)
	public int compareTo(SimEvent right)
	{
		double diff = e_time - right.e_time;
		if (Math.abs(diff) < 0.00001)
			return 0;
