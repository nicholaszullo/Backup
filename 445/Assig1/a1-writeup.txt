Assignment 1 write up

1)The single queue bank method seems to be preferable. The single queue structure results in lower times in maximum wait times, 
both average wait times, and average total time in the bank. Using a single queue is overall better for the customer than 1 queue per teller.
For example, the maximum wait time was reduced by 20 minutes when a single queue is used compared to the mulitqueue with 4 tellers.
Customers spent on average less time in the bank with 1 queue, which is best to keep customers happy.
2)I believe that 3 tellers are the ideal number of tellers. With 3 tellers, all 3 are used evenly by customers coming into the bank.
With 4 tellers, while they are evenly distributed for a multiqueue, we are looking at the single queue numbers. Using 4 tellers in a single
queue brings the average wait time per customer down by 5 minutes, but does not evenly use all 4 tellers. This means that some money is wasted
paying for a 4th teller to do less work. It is more ideal for the customer to have as many tellers as possible, but for business it is best to have 3.
The more tellers in the bank the smaller the wait time, which is ideal for customers. A 3 teller bank also turns away a similar amount of customers
as a 4 teller bank, both small numbers. More customers had to wait with 3 tellers, but it is not better for the business to pay for 4 tellers.
